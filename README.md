## Overview

Welcome to the **Vert.x Reactive Programming Assessment**. This hands-on technical evaluation is designed to assess your expertise in building high-performance, scalable applications using modern reactive programming principles.

### What You'll Build
You'll develop a **complete RESTful API** for an international **Airline Booking System** that handles real-world scenarios including flight searches, passenger management, and booking operations across global airline networks.

### What We're Evaluating
This assessment measures your proficiency in:
- **Reactive Programming Patterns** - Mastery of non-blocking, event-driven architectures
- **Asynchronous Processing** - Proper use of Futures, Promises, and async flows
- **System Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns and modular design
- **Quality Engineering** - Comprehensive testing with enforced coverage thresholds
- **DevOps Practices** - Containerization and deployment readiness

### Why This Matters
In today's high-throughput, low-latency world, reactive programming isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential. This assessment simulates real production challenges where:
- **Thousands of users** search for flights simultaneously
- **Database operations** must never block the event loop
- **System resilience** is critical for handling failures gracefully
- **Scalability** requirements demand efficient resource utilization

## Business Domain: Global Airline Booking System

### Domain Overview
You're building the backbone of a **global airline reservation platform** that connects travelers with flights operated by major international carriers. Think of systems powering platforms like Booking.com, Expedia, Kayak, or airline-specific booking engines.

### Core Entities & Relationships
The system orchestrates four interconnected business domains:

- **Airlines**: International carriers from diverse regions (Emirates, Qatar Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Singapore Airlines, etc.)
- **Flights**: Scheduled routes connecting major global hubs with real-time availability and pricing
- **Passengers**: Traveler profiles with international documentation and preferences
- **Bookings**: Reservation transactions with unique references, seat assignments, and payment processing

### Real-World Complexity
Your implementation will handle authentic scenarios:
- **Multi-regional flight networks** spanning the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Americas
- **Dynamic seat availability** that updates with each booking transaction
- **International passenger data** with diverse naming conventions and documentation
- **Booking lifecycle management** from reservation to cancellation

**IMPORTANT**: You **MUST use the provided database schema and seed data**. Do not create your own schema.

The database schema and seed data are already provided in:
- `src/main/resources/V1__create_schema.sql` - Database tables and indexes
- `src/main/resources/V2__insert_data.sql` - Sample data from global airlines

**Your application must:**

- Use the exact table structure and relationships as defined

### Entities
1. **Airlines** - Airline companies (Emirates, Qatar Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, etc.)
2. **Flights** - Flight schedules with routes connecting different global regions
3. **Passengers** - Customer profiles with global diversity
4. **Bookings** - Ticket reservations with booking references

## REST API Endpoints to Implement

You must implement these **10 REST API endpoints** with proper JSON responses:

### Airlines
- `POST /airlines` → Add a new airline
- `GET /airlines` → List all airlines

### Flights  
- `POST /flights` → Add a new flight for an airline
- `GET /flights/{id}` → Get flight details by ID
- `GET /flights/search?from=X&to=Y` → Search flights by route

### Passengers
- `POST /passengers` → Add a passenger

### Bookings
- `POST /bookings` → Book a ticket for a passenger on a flight
- `GET /bookings/{id}` → Retrieve booking details
- `DELETE /bookings/{id}` → Cancel a booking
- `GET /passengers/{id}/bookings` → List all bookings of a passenger

### API Requirements
- All endpoints must return **JSON responses**

### Sample API Usage

Once implemented, you should be able to test with curl. For more details refer to [api-examples.md](api-examples.md) file.

```bash
# Get all airlines
curl http://localhost:8080/airlines

# Add new airline
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/airlines \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"VS","name":"Virgin Atlantic","country":"United Kingdom"}'

# Search flights
curl "http://localhost:8080/flights/search?from=LHR&to=JFK"

# Create booking
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"passengerId":1,"flightId":1,"seatNumber":"12A"}'
```

## Database Configuration

The H2 database is configured in `application.json`:
- **URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:airline_booking`
- **User**: `sa`
- **Password**: (empty)
- Database initializes automatically with schema and sample data

## Submission Guidelines

Your solution should demonstrate:
- Working REST API with all 10 endpoints
- Proper Vert.x reactive patterns
- Non-blocking database operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Complete unit test suite with **a minimum 85% coverage**
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Successful `mvn clean verify` build (enforces a coverage threshold)

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Coverage Thresholds
The build is configured with **JaCoCo Maven plugin** to enforce minimum test coverage:

- **Line Coverage**: 85% minimum
- **Instruction Coverage**: 85% minimum  
- **Branch Coverage**: 80% minimum

### Coverage Enforcement
- The build will **FAIL** if coverage falls below these thresholds
- Run `mvn clean verify` to check coverage compliance
- Coverage reports are generated in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Exclusions
The following are excluded from coverage requirements:
- Simple POJO model classes (`**/model/*`)
- Main method entry points

### Coverage Tips
- Focus on testing business logic, handlers, and service layers
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use Vert.x test utilities for async testing
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Time Expectation
This assessment is designed to take approximately **4–6 hours** to complete for an experienced developer.

Focus on demonstrating your understanding of reactive programming principles and Vert.x framework capabilities rather than perfect UI or extensive business logic.

## Ready to Take Flight?
